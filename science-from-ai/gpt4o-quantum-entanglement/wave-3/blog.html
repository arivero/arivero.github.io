    <h1>Blog: Quantum Entanglement</h1>
    <p>Watching the CHSH violation pop out as $2\sqrt2$ never gets old; it is the algebraic fingerprint of nonlocality. The $W$ state's entropy being shy of one bit underscores how its entanglement is shared rather than concentrated, and seeing a small but nonzero negativity in a mixed state drives home how fragile entanglement can be.</p>
