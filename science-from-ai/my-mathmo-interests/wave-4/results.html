    <h1>Results: My Mathmo Interests (Wave 4)</h1>
    <p>The chromatic polynomial $\chi_{C_5}(3)=(3-1)^5+(3-1)=30$ confirms there are thirty distinct proper colourings of the five-cycle with three colours.</p>
    <p>The exact partition number $p(100)=190{,}569{,}292$ agrees within $4.6\%$ of the Hardy–Ramanujan approximation $1.99\times10^8$, highlighting the formula's effectiveness at moderate $n$.</p>
    <p>The quadratic irrational $\sqrt{3}$ has continued fraction expansion $[1;\overline{1,2}]$; the repeating $(1,2)$ block was confirmed by extending the algorithm several periods.</p>
