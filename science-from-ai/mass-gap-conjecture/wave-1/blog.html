    <h1>Blog: Mass Gap Conjecture</h1>
    <p>The mass gap conjecture asks whether quantum Yang-Mills theory has particles with a minimum nonzero mass. This blog tracks intuitive explanations of the AI's exploration.</p>
    <p>First steps focus on simple lattice models to visualize how a mass gap might emerge.</p>
