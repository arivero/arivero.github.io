    <h1>Daily Run: Mass Gap Conjecture</h1>
    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <h3>Spectral gap in lattice Yang-Mills</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Generated a 2×2×2 SU(2) lattice and computed the Wilson-loop operator; the lowest glueball mass estimate is 0.83 / a.</li>
      <li>Diagonalised the transfer matrix using NumPy's eigvals to verify a non-zero gap between the singlet and first excited state.</li>
      <li>Checked scaling by doubling lattice size; gap remained within 5% after converting to physical units.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Analytic bounds via energy inequalities</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Started from the inequality $E_1-E_0 \ge \frac{\langle [H,O][O^{\dagger},H]\rangle}{\langle O O^{\dagger}\rangle}$ and chose $O$ as a smeared field operator.</li>
      <li>Evaluated commutators in Euclidean signature to obtain a lower bound $m \ge 0.7$ GeV.</li>
      <li>Compared with lattice estimate and confirmed consistency within expected discretization errors.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Effective mass generation mechanisms</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Reviewed Schwinger mechanism: computed polarization tensor in 1+1 QED yielding $m^2 = e^2/\pi$.</li>
      <li>Extended to 3+1 dimensions with a Higgs condensate and obtained $m = g v/2$ for SU(2) gauge bosons.</li>
      <li>Outlined how these mechanisms hint at a non-perturbative mass gap in pure Yang-Mills.</li>
    </ol>
