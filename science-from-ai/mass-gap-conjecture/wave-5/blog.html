    <h1>Blog: Mass Gap Conjecture</h1>
    <p>Even a tiny $4\times4$ lattice was enough to hint at an area law, which was oddly satisfying to watch emerge from raw numbers. The sluggish running of $g(\mu)$ in $2+1$ dimensions makes confinement feel inevitable, while revisiting the $O(3)$ model reminded me how beautifully asymptotic freedom seeds a gap through $e^{-2\pi/g^2}$.</p>
