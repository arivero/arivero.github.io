    <h1>Blog: Connes' Standard Model</h1>
    <p>The first wave sets up the noncommutative framework and toys with a supersymmetric extension.</p>
    <p>We tallied the 12 generators of the Standard Model gauge group and sketched how squarks and sleptons would appear: 48 new scalar partners in total.</p>
    <p>A quick random Yukawa matrix confirmed that full rank couplings are typical, giving distinct masses for each generation.</p>
