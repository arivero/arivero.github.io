    <p>Re-deriving $a_0=2/3$ for the four-sphere felt like checking a trusted constant. The CKM matrix keeps whispering about tiny complex phases, yet the RG running was the star—seeing $g_1$, $g_2$, and $g_3$ huddle near each other at $10^{16}$\,GeV hints that unification isn't entirely a fantasy.</p>
